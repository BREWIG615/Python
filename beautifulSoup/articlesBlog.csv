SQLite,"For the university we have to prepare presentations for different Databases. My friend and me chose “SQLite”, so I started collecting some info. SQLite is a relational database management system and the most used database engine in the world. .Its a very small library, depending on which platform you use it can be only 600kb big. It is embedded into your application and runs there locally, meaning there is no server needed. .All you need to do is to create an SQLite database in your application and then you are able to use SQL to access and change the data. The database file is stored in your project. The SQLite library is already part of Android Studio so you can have a head start..I found an example project for Android Studio online, which shows how you can use SQLite inside your Android app, this is the link:https://github.com/ravi8x/AndroidSQLite ..You find the database file of this project like this: run your virtual device or connect the phone and run your app. Click on view→tool windows→ device file explorer. Then go to the folder data/data/info.androidhive.sqlite/databases.Which databases are your favorites? Have a nice Sunday! 😊"
How to solve complex problems,"How can you better solve complex coding problems? Here are a few tips:1. Work test-drivenWrite your tests first, and then your code. Like this you can immediately check if your code is doing what you want. Also this helps to have all your code covered with tests.2. Use the debuggerThe debugger is very powerful, as you can run and stop your code line by line and see which values your variables have at the corresponding line, for example. .3. Write detailed pseudo-codeWith pseudo-code you write down in “normal language” what your code is supposed to do. Its important that you write very detailed and exact pseudo-code, so that its easy for you to fill in the actual code later.4. Use Jacocoverage / other coverage toolsIn Netbeans you can download a Plug-in called Jacocoverage, which checks which parts are covered by tests and to what degree. Like this its easy for you to fill in the gaps.What are your tips for solving complex coding problems? Have a nice Sunday! 😊"
